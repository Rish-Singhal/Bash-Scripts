1. "^.\{34\}.\+$" here ^-> start of line , .->character, {34} means 34 occurances of previous character and then .\+ means 1 and more character and at last $ means end of line..... so altogether it will grep all the lines with more than or equal to 35 characters && after that simple sed command is used for replacing in with infact "s/\bin\b/infact/g" s->subsitute and g->means global(i.e. replace all occurances of "in")
here \b means starting of a word or ending of word so "\bin\b" will highlight words in not if in occures in a word like "bbuinnn" .... 


2. "^.*$" means all the lines ( I have used this because grep command is necessary but due to the output.txt all lines should be printed, so grep should highlight all lines) ... *-> 0 or more occurances of previous specified token....
 then the main command comes "AWK" if $3(that is word in third column) is "apathy" then it replaces $3 with "empathy" and print lines irrespective of if any changes are made or not ... then  usual sed  (although not required here ) but just to use it I used it to replace x with x :)....


3. Here split command first will split the word into individual characters then I iterated over the word from 1 to length($0 i.e. word) and if the iterator is less than i I printed the same character else i printed # and atlast "\n"->new line character

4. here i have used -F':' ( this acts like a delimiter ) and here $1-> is first word before the delimiter ... then i printed USER # (NR->used for printing line number) "=" and $1 .....

5.here firstly I greped all the car numbers of the type \w\+(\+ means 1 or more occurances of \w here){some word)(- or space(this will be same for all future occurances) ) \{3\} ( 3 times of this token) then one more word..... then I used grep for matching the pattern TS(starting)( - or space) 2 characters of the type [0-9] or [A-Z] then ( - or space )then two characters then either 55 or SS then (- or space ) then either 0 or O .....
